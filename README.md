# MathV2

What if math was taught differently? More Effectively? I have very little authority to say anything on the matter, but I still feel like there are significant, systemic issues with the American mathematics education. So, this is a project of mine to work on creating a better way of teaching math. 

My main goals with the project are as follows: show people *why* they should love math and show people math, not memorization. So much of math, and especially in traditional middle and high school classes, is just asking kids to memorize formulas and become these human calculators. Well I have news for you, this isn't very impressive in an age where our smartphones can solve differential equations and our bills are all automatically calculated by some other computer. Not to mention that this is **boring**. **Super boring**. It is no wonder why so many kids decide that math is stupid, boring, useless, and uninteresting before they even give math a chance. 

But so many people (and seemingly especially those tasked with teaching the next generation of kids?), when told this isn't what math is, look at you confused and reject the idea: "Math is 2+2=4 and nothing else." Okay, maybe not that extreme, but the amount of people who have it in their head that math is simply computation is staggering. "Math isn't creativity, it's rules, and kids must know those rules." "Knowing your multiplication tables is the most important thing in math." "If you don't have the trigonometry identities memorized by the test you will fail." This isn't math. 

Yes, math involves logic, and a lot of it in fact, but it wasn't "logical" for Issac Newton to expand the Binomial Theorem to negative and fractional numbers. No one at the time thought that was reasonable, logical, or even something worth trying. But to this day, you use the digits of pi that this calculated. It took creativity, foresight, the question: "what happens if I try this?" for Newton to create a system for calculating pi that made all previous methods irrelevant. Let me ask you: is dividing by zero logical? Is doing math on "imaginary numbers," which have no physical meaning, logical? Is representing a simple shape with an irrational number logical? Or sorry, let me rephrase that: Is Calculus, the subject so important it is essentially named "Math," logical? Are the solutions to polynomials logical? Are circles or triangles logical? 

Math is built on logic, but at its core is creativity, exploration, and discovery. Math is the question: "What happens if the square root of negative numbers are actually numbers?" not the question: "Algebra 1 Test, Problem 1: Recite the Quadratic Formula." Mathematicians are those who dare to throw out what others consider fact and instead consider what happens if it isn't fact. 

People, like myself, love math because of this discovery. This inherit creativity within math. The joy of figuring out a problem which has troubled you for hours or finding an unexpected result from something you thought you understood. The moment we tell kids that math is instead about memorization and number crunching they lose this inspiration. They no longer find joy in this amazing subject and drop "math" before they ever take a course where they learn math. 

I hope my rambling introduction wasn't too hard to follow, but if it was, my math teacher from tenth grade calculus gives the following [writing from Paul Lockhart](http://www.andrusia.com/math/LockhartsLament.pdf) as his teaching philosophy, and I think it does a much better job describing what I am trying to say. I encourage everyone to read it for more context. 

## Topics

Below is a running list of the topics I have written so far. My plan is to work on cirruculum from 6th to 12th grade, but it will probably be a long process before I finish everything. 

### Operations
